# English Learning Webpage Project  

This project aims to create a webpage for learning English.  

I have been memorizing content from this site ([CNN YBM](https://cnn.ybmnet.co.kr/main)) to improve my English, but I needed a more convenient tool to assist with the process. Thatâ€™s why I started developing this project.  

## Main Features  
- Provide a page where users can view the full article to understand the context better. This page will include video and audio resources related to the content.  
- Check if the user correctly reproduces a given English sentence based on its Korean translation. 

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement user accounts to save individual study progress.  
- Allow users to create and manage their own content.  
- Integrate content from **Live Academy**, my favorite YouTuber, to enhance the learning experience.
